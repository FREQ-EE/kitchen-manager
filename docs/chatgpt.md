# ChatGPT setup and operation

## One-time setup

Create a ChatGPT Project for your private workspace. Copy docs/project-instructions.md into its instructions and replace the repository and branch placeholders. Connect GitHub and select the private repository. Check the actual tools available: repository reads alone are insufficient; saving requires create/update/commit tools and GitHub write permission. If only a read-only GitHub connector is available, use a Work/Codex repository environment that supports commits, or have ChatGPT prepare a patch that you review and apply locally. It must not report that a patch has already saved.

The local application has no ChatGPT plan requirement. Sites hosting currently requires an eligible paid plan. Voice, plugins and repository-writing capabilities can depend on the surface, plan, region, workspace settings and rollout. This project cannot guarantee that every Free account can perform voice-to-GitHub updates. Check the account's current capability rather than assuming that “GitHub connected” means write access. No OpenAI API key is needed for these ChatGPT workflows.

## Working procedure

State what changed, dictate or paste the actual facts, and ask ChatGPT to update the relevant canonical records. Ask it to read the current version first, use the documented schemas, preserve unrelated fields and confirm the final paths and commit. The locally running app will see those commits when configured for the same GitHub repository and branch. In local-file mode, cloud ChatGPT does not automatically see or modify files on your computer; use a local Work/Codex checkout or apply its patch.

A ChatGPT Project instruction is guidance, not an automatic trigger or a new permission grant. Schedules must be created explicitly through ChatGPT's scheduling capability when available; editing a config file does not schedule a task. Do not send credentials through dictation.

## Useful requests

- “Inventory this shelf from my dictation. Record only ingredients I actually name. Use unknown for unconfirmed stock and null for unknown quantities. Preserve the rest of the pantry.”
- “Record this recipe with the quantities and method I dictate. Link known ingredients to their pantry IDs. Identify gaps instead of filling them with a guessed recipe.”
- “We used the last of this ingredient. Mark it out of stock and keep its replenishment policy.”
- “Add this new recipe to recipes/records and recipes/index.json in one commit, validate its references, and tell me when it has saved.”
- “Create my storage locations and shopping routes from the layout and aisle order I describe.”
